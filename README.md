HOW IT WORKS
------------

You can double-click on the _"Click_me.bat"_ file to open a cmd where you can enter commands from a task. 
Or, having opened in the development environment(I used Eclipse IDE) two files - _Main.java_ and _ObjectOI.java_ - that are in the folder _"sqc"_.

If there is an error while writing the commands(_purchase_, _all_, _report_, _clear_), an  error type message will be displayed (_"Uncorrect type of price." "Can`t connect with <http://fixer.io>").

WHAT's NEXT
-----------

Hopefully, my design does not frighten you, and we can meet in person.
